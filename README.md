# Nanopore Sequencing QC

This project demonstrates a simple workflow for Nanopore FASTQ data QC:

1. Parse FASTQ sequences and quality scores
2. Plot read length distribution
3. Plot average quality score distribution

Tools: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy

Instructions:
- Open 'nanopore_qc.ipynb' in Jupyter or Colab
- Upload your FASTQ file (or use sample.fastq)
- Run all cells to generate plots
