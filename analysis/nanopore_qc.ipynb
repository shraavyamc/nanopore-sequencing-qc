# Nanopore Sequencing Quality Control

This notebook explores basic quality metrics of nanopore sequencing data, including read length distribution and quality score trends, to understand experimental variability and sequencing performance.

## Scientific Question

How do read length distribution and quality scores reflect nanopore sequencing performance and experimental conditions?
